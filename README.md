project-euler
=============

This repository contains all of my answers to the programming problems found on Project Euler (projecteuler.net). Each solution is written in Java and is intended to be run from the command line. Some solutions may also require a text file as input. If so, this will be indicated as a comment in the source code of the solution. I will strive to make all solutions as general as possible, so any given solution should produce the correct answer if given a different input file. Depending on the complexity of the problem, solutions may also include comments explaining my approach to solving 

If you have any interest in solving Project Euler problems yourself, be aware that these solutions are not designed as hints or aids to help others solve the problems, and looking at or running the solutions may spoil your enjoyment of the associated problems. That said, I don't mind if anyone uses my solutions to help them solve the problems, though, if on the off-chance I solve any of the recent problems, I will most likely withhold my solutions to them until they have been solved by a decent number of people.
